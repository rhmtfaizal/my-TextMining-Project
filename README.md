# my-TextMining-Project
my final project on text mining by making a classification of SMS Bahasa using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

this repository contains 2 files, project.py and stop_words.txt. project.py is the code which built to make a model to classify SMS. stop_words.txt is used to eliminate stop word on each data. the classifier can determine 3 categories of SMS which are promo, fraud, and normal SMS. for the dataset itself, i use dataset from http://nlp.yuliadi.pro/dataset. and also, the dataset languange is bahasa.
